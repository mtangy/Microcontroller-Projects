Various projects from Microcontrollers course 

All projects in this repositorie are inttended for the PSoC 1 microcontroller. To use, projects must be opened and compiled through 
PSoC Designer which can be found on Cypress's website (http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-designer). After compiling, the resulting HEX
file must be uploaded onto the microcontroller via PSoC Desighner or PSoC Programmer software.
