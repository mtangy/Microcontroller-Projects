# Microcontroller-Projects
Various projects from my Microcontrollers course for Cypress's PSoC microcontroller.All projects in this repository are inttended for the PSoC 1 microcontroller. To use, projects must be opened and compiled through PSoC Designer which can be found on Cypress's website (http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-designer). After compiling, the resulting HEX file must be uploaded onto the microcontroller via PSoC Desighner or PSoC Programmer software.
